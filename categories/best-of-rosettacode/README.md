# Rosetta code

http://rosettacode.org

This directory contains some good examples taken from rosettacode.org. We make
an effort to pick examples that cover some useful or novel aspect of the Perl
6 language and share some pointers about where to get more information about
these features.

If you find an instructive example on rosettacode.org, then share it here!
