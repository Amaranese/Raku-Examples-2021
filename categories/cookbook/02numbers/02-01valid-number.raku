=TITLE Valid Number

=AUTHOR Steve Mynott

You want to check if a string is a valid number.

Most of the time you will not need to do this.  Rather then testing for a
scalar's numerical nature you can ensure that the variable contains a number
by setting its type.  Assigning a number to that variable will cause it to
be coerced into an integer or a number.

Ensure that a variable is used to store a real number.

  my Num $number;

Ensure that a variable is used to store an integer.

  my Int $integer;

Sometimes you need to validate a string from some source corresponds to a
real or an integer.  In this situation compare it against the rule for
integers or reals.

type(12);

type(14.12);

sub type ( $string) {
    print $string ~ ' is a ';
    given $string {
        when Int { say "Integer"; }
        when Rat { say "Rational"; }
    }
}
