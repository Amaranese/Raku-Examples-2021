# PLEAC: Programming Language Examples Alike Cookbook

This is PLEAC, from https://github.com/pleac/pleac

PLEAC stands for "Programming Language Examples Alike Cookbook."  Think "Perl6
Cookbook."  This is our attempt to recreate the Perl5 Cookbook but with proper
Perl 6 idioms.  Naturally, it's an evolving process.

Note the naming of the directories and the files are done in such a way as to
mirror the Cookbook (2nd Edition) and to ease sorting.  Please do not use the
1st edition section names.

NOTE:

  - This was a port from the now defunct `pugs/examples/cookbook` which then
    became `mu/examples/cookbook` supporting Rakudo.
  - PLEAC itself doesn't seem very active
