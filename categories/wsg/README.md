# Winter Scripting Games

http://www.microsoft.com/technet/scriptcenter/funzone/games/default.mspx

This is a directory to post solutions to the winter scripting games events.
It is further divided by difficulty and year (beginner-2008, advanced-2007,
etc.)

Use the file format `event000-author.pl` replacing 000 with the problem number
and author with your name.  For example if I am eric256 and I answer problem
one I will save it as `event001-eric256.pl`.

Thanks for playing!
